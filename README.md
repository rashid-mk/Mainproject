# Automatic Attendance System Using Face Recognition

This project is aimed at developing an Automatic Attendance System using face recognition, which can be used in educational institutions, offices and other places, where attendance is taken regularly. The system will detect and recognize faces of individuals and mark their attendance accordingly.

This system will use the latest face recognition techniques to identify the individuals and mark their attendance. It will also keep track of the attendance data and generate reports for further analysis.

The main objectives of this project are as follows: 

1. Design and develop a face recognition based attendance system.
2. Develop a user-friendly interface for the system.
3. Design an efficient and secure database to store attendance data.
4. Generate reports of attendance data for further analysis.

This project will be developed using technologies like Python, OpenCV and MySQL. It will require proper testing and evaluation before being deployed. The project will be available on GitHub for the public.
